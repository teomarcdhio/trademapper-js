Licensing

The code for TradeMapper has been made open-source and is freely available on GitHub https://github.com/trademapper/trademapper-js. We have made it open-source to encourage individuals and organisations outside of TRAFFIC to refine and further develop the tool; extending its potential beyond the original project. The open-source code does not contain the TRAFFIC logo.

Any re-use of  the TradeMapper source code is governed under the GPLv3 license as defined by the Open Source Initiative, meaning that any re-use of the code must retain the copyright and conditions, and that the names of the original creators cannot be used to endorse products derived from the software without explicit permission (for more information see http://opensource.org/ licenses/GPL-3.0)
